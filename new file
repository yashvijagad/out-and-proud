Male homosexuality has been acknowledged in
China since ancient times and was mentioned in many famous works of
Chinese literature.
Confucianism, being primarily a social and
political philosophy, focused little on sexuality, whether homosexual or
heterosexual.
In contrast, the role of women is given
little positive emphasis in Chinese history, with records of lesbianism
being especially rare.
Still, there are also descriptions of
lesbians in some history books.
It is believed homosexuality was popular in
the Song, Ming and Qing dynasties.
Chinese literature recorded multiple
anecdotes of men engaging in homosexual relationships.
In the story of the leftover peach(ä½™æ¡ƒ),
set during the Spring and Autumn Era, the historian Han Fei recorded an
anecdote in the relationship of Mi Zixia (å½Œå ç‘•) and Duke Ling of Wei
(è¡›é ˆå…¬) in which Mizi Xia shared an especially delicious peach with
his lover.
The story of the cut sleeve(æ–è¢–) recorded
the Emperor Ai of Han sharing a bed with his lover, Dongxian (è‘£è³¢);
when Emperor Ai woke up later, he carefully cut off his sleeve, so as not
to awake Dongxian, who had fallen asleep on top of it.
Scholar Pan Guangdan (æ½˜å…‰æ—¦) came to
the conclusion that many emperors in the Han dynasty had one or more male
sex partners.
However, except in unusual cases, such as
Emperor Ai, the men named for their homosexual relationships in the
official histories appear to have had active heterosexual lives as well.
With the rise of the Tang dynasty, China
became increasingly influenced by the sexual morals of foreigners from
Western and Central Asia, and female companions began to replace male
companions in terms of power and familial standings
The following Song dynasty was the last
dynasty to include a chapter on male companions of the emperors in
official documents.
During these dynasties, the general
attitude toward homosexuality was still tolerant, but male lovers started
to get seen as less legitimate compared to wives and men were usually
expected to get married and continue the family line.
During the Ming Dynasty, it is said that
the Zhengde Emperor had a homosexual relationship with a Muslim leader
named Sayyid Husain.
In later Ming Dynasty, homosexuality began
to be referred to as the "southern custom" due to the fact that Fujian was
the site of a unique system of male marriages, attested to by the
scholar-bureaucrat Shen Defu and the writer Li Yu, and mythologized by in
the folk tale, The Leveret Spirit.
The Qing dynasty instituted the first law
against consensual, non-monetized homosexuality in China.
However, the punishment designated, which
included a month in prison and 100 heavy blows, was actually the lightest
punishment which existed in the Qing legal system.
In Dream of the Red Chamber, written during
the Qing Dynasty, instances of same-sex affection and sexual interactions
described seem as familiar to observers in the present as do equivalent
stories of romances between heterosexual people during the same period.
Significant efforts to suppress
homosexuality in China began with the Self-Strengthening Movement, when
homophobia was imported to China along with Western science and
philosophy.

Pre-Meiji Japan
Records of men who have sex with
men in Japan date back to ancient times.
However, they became most apparent
to scholars during the Edo period.
Historical practises of
homosexuality is usually referred to in Japan as wakashudÅ (è‹¥è¡†é “,
lit.â€‰'way of the wakashu') and “nanshoku (ç”·è‰², lit.â€‰'male colors').
The institution of wakashudÅ in
Japan is in many ways similar to pederasty in ancient Greece.
Older men usually engaged in
romantic relationships with younger men (the wakashu), usually in their
teens.
In the classic Japanese literature
The Tale of Genji, written in the Heian Era, men are frequently moved by
the beauty of young boys.
In one scene the hero is rejected
by a lady and instead sleeps with her young brother: "Genji pulled the boy
down beside him ... Genji, for his part, or so one is informed, found the
boy more attractive than his chilly sister".
Some references also contain
references to emperors involved in homosexual relationships and to
"handsome boys retained for sexual purposes" by emperors.
In other literary works can be
found references to what Leupp has called "problems of gender
identity",such as the story of a youth's falling in love with a girl who
is actually a cross-dressing male.
Post Meiji Japan
As Japan started it process of
westernizing during the Meiji era, homophobia was imported from western
sources into Japan and animosity towards same-sex practices started
growing.
In 1873 Ministry of Justice passed
the keikan (é¶ å§¦) code, a sodomy law criminalizing homosexual practices.

Throughout Hindu and Vedic texts
there are many descriptions of saints, demigods, and even the Supreme Lord
transcending gender norms and manifesting multiple combinations of sex and
gender.
There are several instances in
ancient Indian epic poetry of same sex depictions and unions by gods and
goddesses.
There are several stories of
depicting love between same sexes especially among kings and queens.
Kamasutra, the ancient Hinduism
based Indian treatise on love talks about feelings for same sexes.
There are several depictions of
same-sex sexual acts in Hindu temples like Khajuraho.
Several Mughal noblemen and
emperors and other Muslim rulers of South Asia are known to have had
homosexual inclinations.
In South Asia the Hijra are a caste
of third-gender, or transgender group who live a feminine role.
Hijra may be born male or intersex,
and some may have been born female.

Same-sex relationships did not
replace marriage between man and woman, but occurred before and beside it.
A mature man would not usually
have a mature male mate (with exceptions such as Alexander the Great and
the same-aged Hephaestion) but the older man would usually be the erastes
(lover) to a young eromenos (loved one).
Men could also seek adolescent
boys as partners as shown by some of the earliest documents concerning
same-sex pederastic relationships, which come from ancient Greece.
Often they were favored over
women.
Though slave boys could be bought,
free boys had to be courted, and ancient materials suggest that the father
also had to consent to the relationship.
Same-sex relationships were a
social institution variously constructed over time and from one city to
another.
The formal practice, an erotic yet
often restrained relationship between a free adult male and a free
adolescent was valued for its pedagogic benefits and as a means of
population control, though occasionally was blamed for causing disorder.
Plato praised its benefits in his
early writings [e.g., Phaedrus in the Symposium (385â€“370 BCE)] but in
his late works proposed its prohibition [e.g., in Laws.
In the Symposium (182B-D), Plato
equates acceptance of homosexuality with democracy and its suppression
with despotism, and wrote that homosexuality "is shameful to barbarians
because of their despotic governments, just as philosophy and athletics
are, since it is apparently not in best interests of such rulers to have
great ideas engendered in their subjects, or powerful friendships or
physical unions, all of which love is particularly apt to produce".
Aristotle, in the Politics,
dismissed Plato's ideas about abolishing homosexuality; he explains that
barbarians like the Celts accorded it a special honor, while the Cretans
used it to regulate the population.
Female youths are depicted
surrounding Sappho in this painting of Lafond "Sappho sings for Homer",
1824.
The ideal held that both partners
would be inspired by love symbolized by Eros, the erastes unselfishly
providing education, guidance, and appropriate gifts to his eromenos, who
became his devoted pupil and assistant, while the sexuality theoretically
remained short of penetrative acts and supposedly would consist primarily
of the act of frottage or intercrural sex.
Although this was the ideal,
realistically speaking, it is probable that in many such relationships
fellatio and penetrative anal intercourse did occur.
The hoped-for result was the
mutual improvement of both erastes and eromenos, each doing his best to
excel in order to be worthy of the other.
Kenneth J. Dover, followed by
Michel Foucault and Halperin, assumed that it was considered improper for
the eromenos to feel desire, as that would not be masculine.
However, Dover's claim has been
questioned in light of evidence of love poetry which suggests a more
emotional connection than earlier researchers liked to acknowledge.
Sappho, born on the island of
Lesbos, was included by later Greeks in the canonical list of nine lyric
poets.
The adjectives deriving from her
name and place of birth (Sapphic and Lesbian) came to be applied to female
homosexuality beginning in the 19th century.
Sappho's poetry centers on passion
and love for various personages and both genders.
The narrators of many of her poems
speak of infatuations and love for various females, but descriptions of
physical acts between women are few and subject to debate.

In Ancient Greece and Phrygia, and
later in the Roman Republic, the Goddess Cybele was worshiped by a cult of
people who castrated themselves, and thereafter took female dress and
referred to themselves as female.
These early transgender figures have
also been referred by several authors as early role models.
In Ancient Rome the young male body
remained a focus of male sexual attention, but relationships were between
older free men and slaves or freed youths who took the receptive role in
sex.
The Hellenophile emperor Hadrian is
renowned for his relationship with Antinous.
In Roman patriarchal society, it was
socially acceptable for an adult male citizen to take the penetrative role
in same-sex relations.
Freeborn male minors were strictly
protected from sexual predators (see Lex Scantinia), and men who willingly
played the "passive" role in homosexual relations were disparaged.
No law or moral censure was directed
against homosexual behaviors as such, as long as the citizen took the
dominant role with a partner of lower status such as a slave, prostitute,
or someone considered infamis, of no social standing.
The Roman emperor Elagabalus is
depicted as transgender by some modern writers.
Elagabalus was said to be "delighted to
be called the mistress, the wife, the queen of Hierocles."
Supposedly, great wealth was offered to
any surgeon who was able to give Elagabalus female genitalia.
During the Renaissance, wealthy cities
in northern Italyâ€”Florence and Venice in particularâ€”were renowned for
their widespread practice of same-sex love, engaged in by a considerable
part of the male population and constructed along the classical pattern of
Greece and Rome.
Attitudes toward homosexual behavior
changed when the Empire fell under Christian rule.

hurtful homophobic, biphobic or transphobic language can be. It is
very important to deal with derogatory terms used to describe LGBTQ+
people, but casual comments said in passing, such as describing a
negative situation as ‘gay’, can also be very damaging.
This is incredibly widespread – 90% of young people have, at least
once, used the word ‘gay’ in a negative context. The presence of
homophobic language is strongly linked to bullying. In schools where
students frequently hear homophobic language, 68% of gay pupils are

rarely or never heard.
Often children and young people may not realize how offensive this
kind of talk can be. But throwaway comments can seriously undermine
gay pupils’ self-esteem, with more than 4.5 gay students reporting
they feel distressed when they hear the word ‘gay’ used in this way
If you hear someone use this kind of language, challenge it. Ask them
why they chose to describe a situation like this and not by using
another word, such as ‘annoying’ or ‘bad’. This can make them realize
how inappropriate the word is in this context. If they don’t have a
problem with gay people, why would they associate the word gay with
such negative connotations? Of course, you also need to be aware of
your own language and if you have used this kind of language
yourself, it is important to realize the damage it can do and stop
using it now.
There are other ways that language can be insensitive, including
words that are suggestive of gender stereotypes, such as telling
someone to ‘man up’ or ‘grow a pair’ can also be upsetting,
especially when directed at someone transgender. Again, challenge the
use of this sort of language – as many people have never thought

them as evidence to show your parents, the school or the
police.
● If you feel unable to speak to your parents or a teacher,
perhaps there is another adult you trust that you can speak to
and they can help.
● If you feel able to, ignore the bullying so you are not giving
the bully the reaction they are looking for. Please note, that
if you feel they could get aggressive, do not put yourself at
risk as your safety is more important.

should be reported to the police as a hate crime. Many police
forces have specialist units to deal with these incidents.
